## üîß Getting Started

Follow these steps to get NexoraGuard up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10 or higher
*   `uv` (Python package installer and virtual environment manager)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/tatkaal/NexoraGuard.git
    cd NexoraGuard
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment using `uv`:**
    ```powershell
    uv venv
    # On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    # On macOS/Linux
    # source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies using `uv`:**
    ```powershell
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up necessary configurations:**
    *   Ensure your knowledge base files (e.g., FAQs, product documents) are in the designated `data` directory (or configure the path as needed).
    *   Ensure you have pulled the gemma3:4b and mxbai-embed-large model from ollama (ollama pull gemma3:4b mxbai-embed-large)
    *   Configure any API keys or model endpoints if you are using external services (e.g., OpenAI/Anthropic if not run locally).

5.  **Run the application (example using Streamlit, adjust if different):**
    The project includes an `app.py` which appears to run a Streamlit application.
    ```powershell
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## üí° Future Enhancements & Roadmap

*   **Advanced Fine-Tuning:** Implement the LoRA fine-tuning pipeline (as conceptualized in `nexora_conceptual.ipynb`) using SageMaker for improved tone, domain-specific jargon, and reduced hallucinations.
*   **User Feedback Loop:** Integrate a system for collecting user feedback (thumbs up/down) to continuously improve responses and schedule re-training/fine-tuning jobs.
*   **Multi-lingual Support:** Extend capabilities to support multiple languages.
*   **Enhanced UI/UX:** Develop a more sophisticated user interface with features like chat history, user accounts, and administrative dashboards.
*   **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Full implementation of CloudWatch metrics and Grafana/QuickSight dashboards for performance and SLA tracking.
*   **Automated Evaluation:** Set up automated evaluation pipelines for model performance using metrics like BLEU, ROUGE-L, and grounding scores.
